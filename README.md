This is an ongoing project where I'm building my own Google Home / Alexa style device that can be interacted with via voice commands.

Currently there is just a rough version of the wakeup keyphrase detection, which you can initialize with the `init.py` script by saying the keyphrase you want to wake up the device with 10 times. After that you can run `recognize.py` and it will recognize when you say the keyphrase.
